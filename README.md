# 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' in Python

This is a repository of Python solutions for the book 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' by Andrew Bruce and Peter C. Bruce.
I deliberately choose a book that does not offer Python code, so I would be forced to create it myself. It is a challenging task, and I already can see how it has improved my understanding of statistical concepts and my Python skills. I hope it would serve as a summary and accountability tool for me and would help the fellow learners that took on a similar challenge for themselves.
