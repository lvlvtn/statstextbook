# 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' in Python

This is a repository of Python solutions for book 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' by Andrew Bruce and Peter C. Bruce.
I deliberatelly choose a book that does not offer Python code so I would be forced to create it myself. It is a challanging task and I already can see how it has improved my understanding of statisctical consepts and my Python skills. I hope it would serve as a conspect and accountability tool for me and would help the fellow learners that took on similar challange for themselvs.
